description=Adds in 11 new road maps! Road maps are less detailed than normal maps, but cover a much larger area. | Road maps are designed to replace the world map. Using road maps with the world map will reveal huge chunks of land in much more detail than intended. I did try to add options to not reveal the world map with them, but it's hardcoded in java afaik. | You can still use the world map if you want, but that's not my vision for this. Either resist tapping the M button, or disable the world map in the sandbox settings.
