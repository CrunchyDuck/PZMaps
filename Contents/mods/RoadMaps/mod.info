name=Maps! - Road Maps
id=CDRoadMaps
description=I made sure that maps overlapped a bit, and that divides don't pass through places with buildings.
Road maps are not balanced for use with the auto map! I did try to add options to not reveal the automap with them, but it's hardcoded in java afaik.
Road maps show much less detail than normal maps. Use a real map to find buildings, or mark buildings you find yourself!
This codebase was a pleasure to work with :)
I had considered using a different colour palette for the road maps, but I couldn't find one I liked.
