title=[CD] Maps!
description=Two mods that add in new maps!
description=
description=[h2]Maps! - Road Maps[/h2]
description=Adds 11 new maps that cover the entire world of Zomboid, but at a cost - They only display the roads. To find buildings, you'll either need the map of a specific town, or you'll have to infer where buildings might be!
description=I made sure that maps overlapped a bit, and that divides don't pass through places with buildings, making orientation a little easier.
description=
description=The idea for road maps comes from the early days of Zomboid. You only had the paper maps you found to orient yourself, and I think that really added to the mystery of the world. I wanted to capture that again!
description=Unfortunately in the process of making this mod I learned the whole map and stole that from myself. Hopefully you can still get it though :)
description=
description=Road maps [b]are designed to replace the world map.[/b] Using road maps with the world map will reveal huge chunks of land in much more detail than intended. I did try to add options to not reveal the world map with them, but it's hardcoded in java afaik.
description=You can still use it if you want, but that's not my vision for this. Either resist tapping the M button, or disable the world map in the sandbox settings.
description=
description=[h2]Maps! - Numbered Louisville Maps[/h2]
description=I'm sick and tired of the Louisville maps all stacking!!
description=Renames the Louisville maps to include their segment number, preventing different maps from stacking.
description=
description=[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
description=Both mods can be comfortably added to an existing game and function as expected.
description=
description=[h2]Ideas[/h2]
description=Theres are a few ideas I have for how I can expand this mod in the future. Let me know if any seem cool, or if you have your own ideas :)
description=[list]
description=[*]Adding in maps of minor towns that are unmapped in base game.
description=[*]Adding in satellite view maps, which display the actual terrain.
description=[*]Letting you change the scale of markers added to the map.
description=[*]Giving road maps some unique banners, like vanilla maps.
description=[*]GPS, a rare item that swallows batteries and shows the surrounding area
description=[*]I had considered using a different colour palette for the road maps, but I couldn't find one I liked.

description=The code for maps is actually really well made, in stark contrast to most of the other lua code.
